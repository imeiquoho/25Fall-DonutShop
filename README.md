## 📌 Project Overview

This Windows Forms application simulates a **coffee and donut ordering system** for a local donut shop.  
Users can dynamically add coffee and donut orders, customize each item, and generate a formatted receipt with pricing and totals.

The project was built incrementally following **Lessons 2–5 of the GLA**, focusing on **custom controls**, **derived controls**, **owner-drawn UI**, and **event-driven design**.
